# Congrathlations!

There is my first personal blog!

## Welcome to My Pages

I'm just a common student from [BeiHang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/),you an also say the HUAA.

As you can see,it's such a simple blog with few atractive elements,and I'm just an odinary beings with little knownledge of git. 

Here lies so many things--study,friends,social work etc,to copy with. It's just a kind of entertainment for me. So, the result is NOT my cake. I just enjoy the feeling of gain new knowledge. It's my FAV,of course.

Below are some useful inf for me to master this project. I leave them still here!
